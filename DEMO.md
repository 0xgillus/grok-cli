# Grok CLI - In-Chat Project Creation Demo

This document demonstrates the powerful in-chat project creation feature of Grok CLI.

## How It Works

When you run `grok` and enter interactive chat mode, you can naturally request project creation by describing what you want to build. The CLI uses AI to parse your request, extract project details, and scaffold a complete project structure.

## Example Session

```bash
$ grok
  ██████╗  ██████╗  ██████╗  ██╗  ██╗     ██████╗ ██╗      ██╗
 ██╔════╝  ██╔══██╗ ██╔═══██╗ ██║ ██╔╝    ██╔════╝ ██║      ██║
 ██║  ███╗ ██████╔╝ ██║   ██║ █████╔╝     ██║      ██║      ██║
 ██║   ██║ ██╔══██╗ ██║   ██║ ██╔═██╗     ██║      ██║      ██║
 ╚██████╔╝ ██║  ██║ ╚██████╔╝ ██║  ██╗    ╚██████╗ ███████╗ ██║

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: Include the technology stack you prefer
   - Good: "Create a React todo app with TypeScript"
   - Bad: "Make an app"

2. **Describe the Purpose**: Mention what the project should do
   - Good: "Build me a Python CLI tool for file management"
   - Bad: "Create a Python thing"

3. **Include Framework Preferences**: Specify if you have a preference
   - Good: "Make an Express API with MongoDB"
   - Good: "Create a Vue.js app with Tailwind CSS"

4. **Use Natural Language**: No need for rigid syntax
   - Good: "I want to build a blog website with Next.js"
   - Good: "Can you help me create a Discord bot?"
   - Good: "Please generate a React dashboard for analytics"

## Advanced Usage

You can also combine project creation with immediate questions:

```
> Create a FastAPI backend for a todo app, and then explain how to add database models

Smart project creation detected!
[... project creation flow ...]

Project created successfully!

Now, to add database models to your FastAPI todo app, you'll want to...
